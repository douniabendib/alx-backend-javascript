<h1>JavaScript</h1>
ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth major version of the ECMAScript language specification. ECMAScript is a standardized scripting language that is widely used for web development. ES6 introduced several new features and enhancements to the language, making JavaScript more powerful and expressive.

Some of the key features introduced in ES6 include:

1. Arrow functions: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions and lexically bind the `this` value.

2. Classes: ES6 introduced class syntax, which provides a more familiar and convenient way to define classes and create objects using the `class` keyword. Classes in ES6 are built on top of JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.

3. Modules: ES6 introduced a built-in module system for organizing and reusing JavaScript code. Modules allow you to encapsulate code into separate files and selectively export and import functionality between modules.

4. Template literals: Template literals provide an improved syntax for creating strings. They allow for multiline strings and support variable interpolation using `${}` syntax.

5. Destructuring assignment: Destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a concise way. It provides a convenient syntax for working with complex data structures.

6. Default parameters: ES6 introduced the ability to define default values for function parameters. This allows you to specify default values that are used when the corresponding arguments are not provided.

7. Promises: Promises provide a more elegant way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow you to chain operations and handle errors in a more readable manner.

These are just a few of the many features introduced in ES6. The release of ES6 brought significant improvements to the JavaScript language and has been widely adopted by modern web browsers and developers.
